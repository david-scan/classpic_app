============

Industry initiated College project to create a tablet app. This app was to be used as an extension to a school management system, and would upload photos to this system and tag photos with selections received from the management system. Photos are taken on the device camera. Student names and activity statements are gotten from the system via a JSON based API. The photos with attached names and activity statements are sent back to the system through the same API.
